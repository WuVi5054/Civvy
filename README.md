# Civvy 

Civvy combines education and community engagement into one streamlined experience:

## Features

- **Learn:** A learning platform where users can pick topics to learn and each topic includes modules with educational content followed by interactive quizzes. Users earn experience points (EXP) as they complete modules, track their progress, and save completed courses.

- **Connect:** An events page where users can create, join, and organize local gatherings. These events can focus on activities such as voter registration drives, civic education workshops, or community discussions about political issues. The "Joined Events" tab makes it easy for users to keep track of their participation.

- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile with their progress stats, completed modules, and a navigation hub to access other features easily.

- **Landing Page:** A polished front page to introduce Civvyâ€™s features, creating a welcoming entry point for new users.
